# Article-Web-Scrape
A basic web scrape to pull articles

Working as a security Analyst, I wanted to automate my daily morning article check on my favorite website, infosecindustry.com. So I decide to create a python script to grab the latest 5 articles and headlines.

#Things to add:
  prompt user to ask if they want to open any of them to a browser.
  create a while loop to stay open to open another article if they so choose.
